		<p> His name is Darren Mukiele and we've kept track of his progress after he started training with McKinless Max Performance in 2023. After a year 
			of training he has become a bigger, better and stronger man. Darren is also in a much better mental state than before he joined us.

		<p class="Darrenexp"> "I was previously unsatisfied with my weight and felt depressed when going outside, I was nervous about joining McKinless Max Performance as I felt intimidated about gyms as a whole. But 
			McKinless Max Performance respected me and made me feel welcome. I was determined and a year later I'm a completely different man. I'm fitter and stronger
			both physically and mentally with a new, healthier diet as well"
